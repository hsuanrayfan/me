            <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
            <p>For me, working in the design and digital industry is a very rewarding experience. In particular, it feels truly satisfying to communicate with the clients, to put myself in their shoes, and assist them turning ideas into reality. It is also very gratifying as I get to use both my professional skills and creativity to execute on ideas that solve real-world needs.<br><br> In terms of my past experience, I have been working as a web editor at the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), Taiwan’s largest trade promoter. Among the many projects I worked on at TAITRA, I was in charge of the overall visuals promotion campaign between TAITRA and the Korea International Trade Association (KOTRA), Korea’s largest trade promoting body. My work contributed to the outstanding success of the project and deeply impressed the senior officers of both organizations. As a result, my work became the model reference for future projects.<br><br> Prior to TAITRA, I was an assistant researcher at the National Science Council (NSC) where I completed the thesis for my postgraduate degree at the National Taiwan Normal University.<br><br> Before my position at NSC, I worked for the Taiwan Design Center (TDC). Among my duties, I was in charge of project management, customer service and program consultation. It involved understanding the customers’ needs and interests and then recommending them to suitable workshops and courses. I was also in charge of event organization, which included arranging international forums, seminars, talent matchmaking sessions, and exhibitor recruitment programs.<br><br> In terms of my language skills, I have achieved N1 Level (highest) on the Japanese-Language Proficiency Test, and my French proficiency is currently at the DELF Pro B2 level.
